# 1 Overview of Playwright, Project Structure, and Config

## Goal

This section introduces the Playwright framework, explains the project‚Äôs folder structure and configuration, and demonstrates how to start the sample application and run an initial Playwright test. The aim is to build familiarity with the tools and setup needed for effective end-to-end testing.

## What is Playwright?

Playwright is a powerful open-source framework developed by Microsoft for reliable end-to-end testing and automation of modern web applications. It allows you to write tests that run across all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) using a single API, simulating real user interactions like clicking, typing, and navigating.

This project serves as a hands-on guide for learning Playwright. It involves testing a sample Next.js application (movies-app) using Playwright's features for end-to-end testing. You'll explore the project structure, understand configuration, write and run tests, and learn how to run Playwright tests at scale.

In this section, you'll get familiar with the project setup and run your first Playwright test.

## üóÇ Project Structure Overview

1. [] Open up VS Code to explore the project structure.

![Open the project in VS Code](../images/open-vs-code.png)

Open the project folder in VS Code to get an overview of the files and directories. This will help you understand where the application code, tests, and configuration files are located.

Here's a quick look at the folder layout:

- **movies-app/**  
  The [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application you'll be testing.  
- **tests/**  
  Where the Playwright test files live. You'll see folders like:
  - logged-in/
  - logged-out/
  - helpers/ (utility functions)
  - mocks/ (API mocking utilities)
- **playwright.config.ts**  
  The main config file for Playwright tests.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the App

Run the application.

1. [] Open a new terminal in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the **Terminal** menu and selecting **New Terminal** or using the shortcut (Ctrl + `).

1. [] **Install dependencies**: `npm install` 
2. [] **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
3. [] Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

## ‚úÖ Run Your First Test
1. [] **Open a second terminal in VS Code** Click on the plus button in the terminal window or in the **Terminal** menu select **New Terminal**.

2. [] **Run the movie-list test**: 
`npx playwright test movie-list.spec.ts`

You should see the results in the terminal that two tests passed.

## üí¨ What‚Äôs Happening?

We only ran one test file but as it contained two tests both tests ran. Open up the HMTL report in your browser to see detailed results of the test runs.
1. [] Open the HTML report by running the command:
`npx playwright show-report`

Take a moment to skim the report and view the test results. You can click on individual tests to see more details, including the steps taken during the test and any errors encountered.

- What is it trying to verify?
- Is it checking elements, navigation, or content?

We'll go deeper into test structure soon!

- Understand the project structure.
- Run the application locally.
- Run a Playwright test.
- Understand the Playwright config file.
- Know where to find test files.
